# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
created plot1.R , plot2.R ,plot3.R and plot4.R 
However their corresponding png file are not attached 
though after running the code in my rstudio it gets created.
I believe the evaluator could run the code in his r studio after changing the path of the data file and compare the graph.
